# Introduction to Web Scraping with Python

This repository serves as a practical introduction to web scraping using Python. It contains a collection of scripts and examples demonstrating how to extract data from websites using popular libraries like Beautiful Soup and Requests.

## üìñ Overview

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from websites. This project provides hands-on examples to help you understand the fundamental concepts and techniques involved. Whether you're a developer, a data analyst, or just curious about data collection, these scripts offer a starting point for your web scraping journey.

## ‚ú® Key Concepts Covered

* **HTTP Requests:** Making requests to a web server to retrieve the HTML content of a page.
* **HTML Parsing:** Navigating and searching the HTML structure of a webpage to find the desired data.
* **Data Extraction:** Isolating and extracting specific pieces of information, such as text, links, and image sources.
* **Handling Different HTML Tags:** Techniques for finding and extracting data from various HTML elements like `<div>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<table>`, etc.
* **Saving Data:** Basic examples of how to save the scraped data into a structured format (e.g., CSV).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

The scripts in this repository primarily use the following Python libraries:

* **[Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**: A simple and elegant HTTP library for making web requests.
* **[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)**: A powerful library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
* **[lxml](https://lxml.de/)**: A high-performance and feature-rich XML and HTML parser used with Beautiful Soup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To run these web scraping scripts on your local machine, follow these steps.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/SID41214/Web-Scraping-Intro.git](https://github.com/SID41214/Web-Scraping-Intro.git)
cd Web-Scraping-Intro
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
# Create and activate the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```
*Tip: You can create a `requirements.txt` file with the library names and install them all at once using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.*

### 5. Run a Script

Execute any of the Python scraping scripts. For example:
```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations & Disclaimer

Web scraping is a powerful tool, and it's important to use it responsibly.

* **Respect `robots.txt`**: Always check the `robots.txt` file of a website (e.g., `https://example.com/robots.txt`) to see which parts of the site you are allowed to scrape.
* **Check Terms of Service**: Review the website's terms of service to ensure you are not violating their policies.
* **Don't Overload Servers**: Be respectful of the website's server. Send requests at a reasonable rate and consider adding delays (`time.sleep()`) between your requests.
* **Identify Yourself**: Set a descriptive User-Agent string in your request headers to identify your bot.
